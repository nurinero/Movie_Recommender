Movie Recommender App is a recommendation engine for users based on their past viewing habits. The app uses a small dataset of MovieLens, which includes 100,000 ratings for 9,000 movies by 600 users. Additionally, the app uses movie posters obtained from the OMDb API.

The app implements the following recommender methods:

* Simple Recommender: recommends the most popular movies
* Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* Collaborative Filtering
The app is built with Flask, and users can select their favorite movies. The user can rate the selected movies, and the app recommends 5 movies based on the NMF algorithm.
